ssllabs-scan
============

This tool is a command-line client for the SSL Laps APIs, designed for automated and/or bulk testing.

Because SSL Labs APIs are not yet publicly available at this point, this tool is useful only
to the early adopters, who know the API URL. Once the APIs are pubicly released (soon), the URL
will be embedded in this tool, making it useful out of the box.
