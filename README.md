ssllabs-scan
============

This tool is a command-line client for the SSL Labs APIs, designed for
automated and/or bulk testing.

Because SSL Labs APIs are not yet publicly available, this tool is useful only
to the early adopters, who know the API URL. Once the APIs are pubicly released (soon), the URL
will be embedded in this tool, making it useful out of the box.

If you'd like to contribute, please have a look at the TODO file. For larger work,
please get in touch first. For smaller work (there are some TODO comments in the
source code), feel free to submit pull requests.
