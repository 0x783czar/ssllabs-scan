ssllabs-scan
============

This tool is a command-line client for the SSL Labs APIs, designed for
automated and/or bulk testing. Both the tool and the APIs are still in development,
and should be considered alpha quality.

If you'd like to contribute, please have a look at the TODO file. For larger work,
please get in touch first. For smaller work (there are some TODO comments in the
source code), feel free to submit pull requests.

Before you use this tool please review the terms and conditions, which are included
with the API documentation.
